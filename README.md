# PERL Script for vSphere

In this repo you will find some pretty basic stuff I use to help 
me with vSphere. I wont try to pretend this stuff will be super helpful.
For some really advanced stuff in PERL you should check out what William Lam
has done [here](https://github.com/lamw/vghetto-scripts/tree/master/perl)

I really dont use PERL much these days and the really advanced stuff I have
done is owned by current or former employers, so all you get is some of the 
basic stuff.

enjoy.
